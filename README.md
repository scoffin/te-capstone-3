Tech Elevator Module 3: Web Applications Programming (Server Side)

Project: java-capstone-3 ("National Parks Geek")

Programmers: Sondra Coffin, Michael Mazzullo

Overview: create a web application that displays information about different national parks (data is static)

User stories: 
As a user of the system I want to be able to... 
... view the complete list of all national parks featured in the application from the homepage
... select an individual park from the list to view its details
... view the 5-day forecast for the selected park with additional details for the individual days in the forecast
... choose whether the temperatures I see in the forecast are given in celcius or fahrenheit
... take a user survey to vote for my favorite national park and then see the results from all the app's users' votes combined
